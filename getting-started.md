# Getting Started

A TimescaleDB database behaves in many respects like a standard PostgreSQL
database. It:

- Coexists with other TimescaleDB databases and PostgreSQL databases
  on a PostgreSQL server.
- Uses SQL as its interface language.
- Contains standard database objects like tables, indexes, and triggers.
- Uses common PostgreSQL connectors to third-party tools.

The way the database accomplishes this synchronicity is through its
packaging as a PostgreSQL extension, whereby a standard PostgreSQL
database is transformed into a TimescaleDB database.

The advantages that TimescaleDB offers beyond that of PostgreSQL are primarily
related to handling time-series data.  These advantages are most easily seen
when interacting with [hypertables][], which behave like normal tables yet
maintain high performance even while scaling storage to normally prohibitive
amounts of data.  Hypertables can engage in normal table operations, including
JOINs with standard tables.

Getting started with TimescaleDB involves a few steps:

1. [Installing PostgreSQL and TimescaleDB.][install]
1. [Creating a standard PostgreSQL database and enabling the TimescaleDB extension on the database.][setup]
1. [Creating a hypertable to store your data.][create-hypertables]
1. [Migrating your data to a hypertable][migrate] (optional)
1. [Setting up data node authentication for distributed hypertables][distdb-auth]
