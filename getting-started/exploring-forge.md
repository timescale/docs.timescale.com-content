# Exploring Timescale Forge

Welcome to Timescale Forge! Timescale Forge combines the power and reliability 
of TimescaleDB with a fully-managed, cloud-native experience that is easy to 
start and less expensive to operate.

This tutorial will walk you through setting up your Timescale Forge account and
completing your first tutorial project.

### Step 1: Create a Timescale Forge account

Sign up for Timescale Forge by visiting [forge.timescale.com][forge-signup].

Provide your full name, email address, and a strong password to start:

<img class="main-content__illustration" src="https://assets.iobeam.com/images/docs/forge_images/timescale-forge-signup-page.png" alt="Sign up for Timescale Forge"/>

You will need to confirm your account by clicking the link you receive via 
email. If you do not receive this link, please first check your spam folder 
and, failing that, please [contact us][contact-timescale].

### Step 2: Create your first service

 After you complete account verification, you can visit the 
 [Timescale Forge console][forge-console] and login with your credentials.

 To begin, click 'Create service'.

<img class="main-content__illustration" src="https://assets.iobeam.com/images/docs/forge_images/timescale-forge-service-creation.png" alt="Set up a Timescale Forge service"/>

1. First, supply your service name (e.g., `acmecorp-test` or `acmecorp-dev`).
1. Next, choose your CPU and memory configuration, from (0.5 CPU, 2GB RAM) to (8 CPU, 32 GB RAM).
1. Select your storage requirements, from 25 GB to 1 TB.  Note with TimescaleDB compression, this is typically equivalent to 400 GB to over 16 TB of uncompressed storage (although compression rates can vary based on your data).
1. Note the estimated cost of running your chosen configuration. Feel free to [contact us][contact-timescale] if you would like to discuss pricing and configuration options best suited for your use case.
1. Click 'Create service' once your configuration is complete.

>:TIP:Don't worry if too much about the size settings that you choose initially. With Timescale Forge,
it's easy to modify both the compute (CPU/Memory) and storage associated with the service
that you just created. As you get to know TimescaleDB and how your data processing needs vary,
it's easy to [right-size your service with a few clicks](#forge-resize)!

After you select 'Create service', you will see confirmation of your service account and
password information. You should save the information in this confirmation screen in 
a safe place:

>:WARNING: If you forget your password in the future, you can reset your password from the *service dashboard*.

It will take a couple minutes for your service to be provisioned. When your database is 
ready for connection, you should see a green `Running` label above the service in the
service dashboard.

<img class="main-content__illustration" src="https://assets.iobeam.com/images/docs/forge_images/timescale-forge-service-dashboard.png" alt="View all Timescale Forge services"/>

Select any service to view *service details*. You can obtain connection, 
configuration, and utilization information. In addition, you can reset the
password for your service, power down or power up any service (which stops
or starts your compute, although your storage persists), or delete
a service altogether.

### Step 3: Complete your first tutorial

Congratulations! You are now up and running with Timescale Forge. In order to
familiarize yourself with the features and capabilities of the product, we
recommend that you complete the [Hello, Timescale!][hello-timescale] tutorial.

To simplify operations with TimescaleDB, each Timescale Forge service comprises a
single "database" per PostgreSQL terminology, and all Timescale Forge services
come with TimescaleDB already installed. So skip the `CREATE DATABASE` step
and the "adding the TimescaleDB extension" step of the tutorial and
jump right to the "Define your data schema" section of the [Hello, Timescale!][hello-timescale]
tutorial. Wherever the instructions indicate that you should use the `nyc_data`
database, use `tsdb` instead. `tsdb` is the default database name for every
Timescale Forge service. And if you need another database, it's just a click away.

### Step 4: Learn more about TimescaleDB

Read about TimescaleDB features in our documentation:

- Create your first ”[hypertable][hypertable-info]”.
- Run your first query using [time_bucket()][time-bucket-info].
- Trying more advanced time-series functions, starting with [gap filling][gap-filling-info] or [real-time aggregates][aggregates-info].

### Step 5: Keep testing during your free trial and enter your billing information when you’re ready

You’re now on your way to a great start with Timescale!

You will have an unthrottled, 30-day free trial with Timescale Forge to 
continue to test your use case. Before the end of your trial, we encourage you 
to add your credit card information. This will ensure a smooth transition after 
your trial period concludes.

## Resizing Compute and Storage in Timescale Forge [](forge-resize)

Timescale Forge allows you to resize compute (CPU/RAM) and storage independently at any time. This is extremely
useful when users have a need to increase storage (for instance) but not compute. The Timescale Forge 
console makes this very easy to do for any service.

Before you modify the compute or storage settings for a Forge Service, please note the following limitations
and when a change to these settings will result in momentary downtime.

**Storage**: Storage changes are applied with no downtime, typically available within a few seconds. Other
things to note about storage changes:
 * At the current time, storage can only be increased in size.
 * Storage size changes can only be made once every six (6) hours.
 * Storage can be modified in 25GB increments between 25GB-500GB, and then in 100GB increments between 500GB-1TB.

**Compute**: Modifications to the compute size of your service (increases or decreases) can be applied at any time, however,
please note the following:
 * **_There will be momentary downtime_** while the compute settings are applied. In most cases, this downtime
will be less than 30 seconds.
 * Because there will be an interruption to your service, you should plan accordingly to have the settings 
 applied at an appropriate service window.

### Step 1: View Service operation details 
To modify the compute or storage of your Service, first select the Service that you want to modify. This
will display the _service details_ which list four tabs across the top: Overview, Operations, Metrics, and Logs.

Select **_Operations_**.

<img class="main-content__illustration" src="https://assets.iobeam.com/images/docs/forge_images/timescale-forge-service-operations.png" alt="View Timescale Forge service operational information"/>

### Step 2: Display the current Service Resources
Under the Operations tab, you can perform the same **Basic** operations as before (Reset password, Pause service, Delete service).
There is now a second, advanced section on the left labeled **Resources**. Selecting this option displays the current resource
settings for the Service.

<img class="main-content__illustration" src="https://assets.iobeam.com/images/docs/forge_images/timescale-forge-service-resources.png" alt="View Timescale Forge service resource information"/>

### Step 3: Modify Service resources
Once you have navigated to the current Service resources, it's easy to modify either the compute (CPU/Memory) or
disk size. As you modify either setting, notice that the current and new hourly charges are displayed in real-time
so that it's easy to verify how these changes will impact your costs.

As noted above, changes to disk size will not cause any downtime, but size can only be increased at the current time, 
and only once every six (6) hours. 

When you're satisfied with the changes, click **Apply** (storage resizes only) or **Apply and Restart** (when modifying compute resources).
