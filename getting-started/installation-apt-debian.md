## apt Installation (Debian) [](installation-apt-debian)

This will install TimescaleDB via `apt` on Debian distros.

**Note: TimescaleDB requires PostgreSQL 9.6.3+, 10.2+, or 11.0+**

#### Prerequisites

- Debian 8 (jessie) or 9 (stretch)

#### Build & Install

>:WARNING: If you have another PostgreSQL installation not via `apt`,
this will likely cause problems.
If you wish to maintain your current version of PostgreSQL outside
of `apt`, we recommend installing from source.  Otherwise, please be
sure to remove non-`apt` installations before using this method.

**If you don't already have PostgreSQL installed**, add PostgreSQL's third
party repository to get the latest PostgreSQL packages:
```bash
# `lsb_release -c -s` should return the correct codename of your OS
sudo sh -c "echo 'deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ `lsb_release -c -s`-pgdg main' >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list"
wget --quiet -O - https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update
```

Add TimescaleDB's third party repository and install TimescaleDB (will download
any dependencies it needs from the PostgreSQL repo):
```bash
# Add our repository
sudo sh -c "echo 'deb https://packagecloud.io/timescale/timescaledb/debian/ `lsb_release -c -s` main' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/timescaledb.list"
wget --quiet -O - https://packagecloud.io/timescale/timescaledb/gpgkey | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update

# Now install appropriate package for PG version
sudo apt-get install timescaledb-postgresql-:pg_version:
```

#### Update `postgresql.conf`

>:TIP: The usual location of `postgres.conf`
is `/etc/postgresql/:pg_version:/main/postgresql.conf`, but this may vary
depending on your setup. If you are unsure where your `postgresql.conf` file
is located, you can query PostgreSQL with any database client (e.g., `psql`)
using `SHOW config_file;`.

You will need to edit your `postgresql.conf` file to include
necessary libraries:
```bash
# Modify postgresql.conf to uncomment this line and add required libraries.
shared_preload_libraries = 'timescaledb'
```

>:TIP: If you have other libraries you are preloading, they should be comma separated.

To get started you'll now need to restart PostgreSQL and add
a `postgres` superuser (used in the rest of the docs):
```bash
# Restart PostgreSQL instance
sudo service postgresql restart
```
