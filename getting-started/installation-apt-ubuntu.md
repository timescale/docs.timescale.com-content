## apt Installation (Ubuntu) [](installation-apt-ubuntu)

This will install TimescaleDB via `apt` on Ubuntu distros.

**Note: TimescaleDB requires PostgreSQL 11 or 12.**

#### Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 16.04 or later, except obsoleted versions.
Check [releases.ubuntu.com][ubuntu-releases] for list of
non-obsolete releases.

#### Build & Install

>:WARNING: If you have another PostgreSQL installation not via `apt`,
this will likely cause problems.
If you wish to maintain your current version of PostgreSQL outside
of `apt`, we recommend installing from source.  Otherwise, please be
sure to remove non-`apt` installations before using this method.

**If you don't already have PostgreSQL installed**, add PostgreSQL's third
party repository to get the latest PostgreSQL packages (if you are using Ubuntu older than 19.04):
```bash
# `lsb_release -c -s` should return the correct codename of your OS
echo "deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ $(lsb_release -c -s)-pgdg main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list
wget --quiet -O - https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update
```

Add TimescaleDB's third party repository and install TimescaleDB,
which will download any dependencies it needs from the PostgreSQL repo:
```bash
# Add our PPA
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:timescale/timescaledb-ppa
sudo apt-get update

# Now install appropriate package for PG version
sudo apt install timescaledb-postgresql-:pg_version:
```

#### Configure your database

There are a [variety of settings that can be configured][config] for your
new database. At a minimum, you will need to update your `postgresql.conf`
file to include our library in the parameter `shared_preload_libraries`.
The easiest way to get started is to run `timescaledb-tune`, which is
installed by default when using `apt`:
```bash
sudo timescaledb-tune
```

This will ensure that our extension is properly added to the parameter
`shared_preload_libraries` as well as offer suggestions for tuning memory,
parallelism, and other settings.

To get started you'll now need to restart PostgreSQL and add
a `postgres` [superuser][createuser] (used in the rest of the docs):
```bash
# Restart PostgreSQL instance
sudo service postgresql restart
```
