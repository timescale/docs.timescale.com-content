## Installing from an Amazon AMI (Ubuntu) [](installation-ubuntu-ami)

TimescaleDB is currently available as an Ubuntu 18.04 Amazon EBS-backed AMI. AMIs are
distributed by region, and our AMI is currently available in US and EU
regions. Note that this image is built to use an EBS attached volume
rather than the default disk that comes with EC2 instances.

See below for the image id corresponding to each region for the most recent TimescaleDB version:

Region | Image ID
--- | ---
us-east-1 (North Virginia) | ami-076d325bf420e0952
us-east-2 (Ohio) | ami-0a3ff72f046fa4d4e
us-west-1 (North California) | ami-0ae0f3a3cafefcaa4
us-west-2 (Oregon) | ami-05abda10711dfce76
eu-central-1 (Germany) | ami-0b8d960a285664288
eu-north-1 (Sweden) | ami-03958fe53d180cbfc
eu-west-1 (Ireland) | ami-0cb84a91106e54acf
eu-west-2 (England) | ami-0b8f492748741f1db
eu-west-3 (France) | ami-0e2cabdbd458c373f

To launch the AMI, go to the `AMIs` section of your AWS EC2 Dashboard run the following steps:

* Select `Public Images` under the dropdown menu.
* Filter the image id by the image id for your region and select the image.
* Click the `Launch` button.

You can also use the image id to build an instance using Cloudformation, Terraform,
the AWS CLI, or any other AWS deployment tool that supports building from public AMIs.

TimescaleDB is installed on the AMI, but you will still need to follow the steps for
initializing a database with the TimescaleDB extension. See our [setup][] section for details.
Depending on your user/permission needs, you will also need to set up a postgres superuser for your
database by following these [postgres instructions][]. Another possibility is using the operating
system's `ubuntu` user and modifying the [pg_hba][].

>:WARNING: AMIs do not know what instance type you are using beforehand. Therefore
the PostgreSQL configuration (postgresql.conf) that comes with our AMI uses the default
settings, which are not optimal for most systems. Our AMI is packaged with `timescaledb-tune`,
which you can use to tune postgresql.conf based on the underlying system resources of your instance.
See our [configuration][] section for details.

>:TIP: These AMIs are made for EBS attached volumes. This allows for snapshots, protection of
data if the EC2 instance goes down, and dynamic IOPS configuration. You should choose an
EC2 instance type that is optimized for EBS attached volumes. For information on choosing the right
EBS optimized EC2 instance type, see the AWS [instance configuration page][].
