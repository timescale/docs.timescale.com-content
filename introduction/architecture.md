# Architecture & Concepts

## Overview [](overview)

TimescaleDB is implemented as an extension on PostgreSQL, which means that it
runs within an overall PostgreSQL instance.  The extension
model allows the database to take advantage of many of the attributes of
PostgreSQL such as reliability, security, and connectivity to a wide range of
third-party tools.  At the same time, TimescaleDB leverages the high degree of
customization available to extensions by adding hooks deep into PostgreSQL's
query planner, data model, and execution engine.

From a user perspective, TimescaleDB exposes what look like singular tables,
called **hypertables**, that are actually an abstraction or a virtual view of
many individual tables holding the data, called **chunks**.

Chunks are created by partitioning the hypertable's data into
one or multiple dimensions: All hypertables are partitioned by a time interval,
and can additionally be partitioned by a key such as device ID, location,
user id, etc. We sometimes refer to this as partitioning across "time and space".

## Terminology [](terminology)

### Hypertables [](hypertables)
The primary point of interaction with your data is a hypertable,
the abstraction of a single continuous table across all space and time
intervals, such that one can query it via standard SQL.

Virtually all user interactions with TimescaleDB are with hypertables. Creating
tables and indexes, altering tables, inserting data, selecting data, etc. can
(and should) all be executed on the hypertable. [[Jump to basic SQL operations][jumpSQL]]

A hypertable is defined by a standard schema with column names and
types, with at least one column specifying a time value, and
one (optional) column specifying an additional partitioning key.

>:TIP: See our [data model][] for a further discussion of various
ways to organize data, depending on your use cases;
the simplest and most natural is in a "wide-table" like many
relational databases.

A single TimescaleDB deployment can store multiple hypertables, each
with different schemas.

Creating a hypertable in TimescaleDB takes two simple SQL
commands: `CREATE TABLE` (with standard SQL syntax),
followed by `SELECT create_hypertable()`.

Indexes on time and the partitioning key are automatically created on hypertables,
although additional indexes can also be created (and TimescaleDB supports the
full range of PostgreSQL index types).

### Chunks [](chunks)

Internally, TimescaleDB automatically splits each
hypertable into **chunks**, with each chunk corresponding to a specific time
interval and a region of the partition key’s space (using hashing).
These partitions are disjoint (non-overlapping), which helps the query planner
to minimize the set of chunks it must touch to resolve a query.

Each chunk is implemented using a standard database table.  (In PostgreSQL
internals, the chunk is actually a "child table" of the "parent" hypertable.)

Chunks are right-sized, ensuring that all of the B-trees for a table’s
indexes can reside in memory during inserts.  This avoids thrashing when
modifying arbitrary locations in those trees.

Further, by avoiding overly large chunks, we can avoid expensive "vacuuming"
operations when removing deleted data according to automated retention policies.
The runtime can perform such operations by simply dropping chunks (internal
tables), rather than deleting individual rows.

## Single Node vs. Multi-Node [](single-node-vs-clustering)

TimescaleDB performs this extensive partitioning both
on **single-node** deployments as well as **clustered** deployments
(in private beta).  While
partitioning is traditionally only used for scaling out across multiple
machines, it also allows us to scale up to high write rates (and improved
parallelized queries) even on single machines.

The current open-source release of TimescaleDB only supports single-node
deployments. Of note is that the single-node version of TimescaleDB has been
benchmarked to over 10-billion-row hypertables on commodity machines without
a loss in insert performance.

## Benefits of Single-node Partitioning [](benefits-chunking)

A common problem with scaling database performance on a single machine
is the significant cost/performance trade-off between memory and disk.
Eventually, our entire dataset will not fit in memory, and we’ll need
to write our data and indexes to disk.

Once the data is sufficiently large that we can’t fit all pages of our indexes
(e.g., B-trees) in memory, then updating a random part of the tree can involve
swapping in data from disk.  And databases like PostgreSQL keep a B-tree (or
other data structure) for each table index, in order for values in that
index to be found efficiently. So, the problem compounds as you index more
columns.

But because each of the chunks created by TimescaleDB is itself stored as a
separate database table, all of its indexes are built only across these much
smaller tables rather than a single table representing the entire
dataset. So if we size these chunks properly, we can fit the latest tables
(and their B-trees) completely in memory, and avoid this swap-to-disk problem,
while maintaining support for multiple indexes.

For more on the motivation and design of TimescaleDB's adaptive space/time
chunking, please see our [technical blog post][chunking].

## TimescaleDB Clustering (PRIVATE BETA) [](timescaledb-clustering)

TimescaleDB supports multi-node clustering by leveraging the hypertable and chunk primitives described above.
In the multi-node topology, all nodes are TimescaleDB instances, but may play different roles
depending on their responsibilities within a distributed database.

### Node Types

The two roles that nodes can take on are:
1) Access node
2) Data node

A access node accepts all requests from the client, distributes the requests and queries
appropriately to data nodes, and aggregates the results received from the data nodes.
Access nodes store cluster-wide information about the different data nodes as well as how
chunks are distributed across those data nodes. Access nodes can also store non-distributed
hypertables, as well as regular PostgreSQL tables.

Data nodes store data associated with distributed hypertables. Data nodes do not store cluster-wide
information, and otherwise look just as if they were single TimescaleDB instances. Avoid
directly accessing local hypertables or chunks of a distributed hypertable on a data node
as the action can fail or make the distributed hypertable inconsistent. There are
very few reasons to ever access a data node directly, and all accesses should be done at
the access node level.

It is important to note that access nodes and data nodes both run TimescaleDB, and for all intents and
purposes, look just like a single instance of TimescaleDB from an operational perspective. However, as
mentioned above, all accesses for a distributed hypertable should go through the access node, and
you should not access the data node directly.

### Distributed Databases

A multi-node TimescaleDB cluster contains distributed databases on which distributed hypertables can be created. Distributed databases should be configured
to have one primary access node and multiple data nodes. An access node cannot also be a data node.
We currently only support a single primary access node that will automatically dispatch all operations on distributed hypertables to the appropriate data node(s).

### Distributed Hypertables

As discussed above, distributed databases contain distributed hypertables. Distributed hypertables are essentially
the same as regular hypertables, except that they have an additional layer of abstraction where
access nodes must be able to logically manage distributed hypertables. Distributed hypertables
are also composed of chunks.

With distributed hypertables, we suggest partitioning the hypertables both by space and by time.
If you only partition data by time, that chunk will have to fill up before the access node chooses
another data node to store the next chunk, and thus during that chunk's time interval, all writes
to the latest interval will be handled by a single data node, rather than load balanced across all
available data nodes. On the other hand, if you specify a space partition, the access node
will distribute chunks across multiple data nodes based on the space partition so that multiple
chunks are created for a given chunk time interval, and both reads and writes to that recent time
interval will be load balanced across the cluster.

By default, we automatically set the number of space partitions equal to the number of data nodes
if a value is not specified. The system will also increase the number of space partitions, if necessary,
when adding new data nodes. If setting manually, we recommend that the number of space partitions are
equal or a multiple of the number of data nodes associated with the distributed hypertable for optimal data distribution
across data nodes. In case of multiple space partitions, only the first space partition will be used to determine
how chunks are distributed across servers.

### Scaling out with TimescaleDB Clustering

As time-series data grows, a common use case is to add data nodes to expand the storage and compute
capacity of your TimescaleDB Cluster. TimescaleDB can be elastically scaled out by simply adding data nodes to
a distributed database.

As mentioned earlier, TimescaleDB can (and will) adjust the number of space partitions as new data nodes are
added. Although existing chunks will not have their space partitions updated, the new settings will be applied to
newly created chunks. Because of this behavior, we do not need to move data between data nodes when the cluster size is
increased, and simply update how data is distributed for the next time interval. Writes for new incoming data will
leverage the new partitioning settings, while the access node can still support queries across all chunks (even those
that were created using the old partitioning settings). Do note that although the number of space partitions
can be changed, the column on which the data is partitioned can not be changed.
