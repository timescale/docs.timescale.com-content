### Coming down the pipeline

The team is actively working on the multi-node version 
of TimescaleDB which is currently in beta. To read more 
about how we plan to support a distributed architecture, 
click [here](https://docs.timescale.com/clustering/introduction/architecture#distributed-hypertables). 
To test out the beta version for yourself, 
follow these [instructions](https://docs.timescale.com/clustering/getting-started/scaling-out). 

Currently, we expect this major feature to be released
in H1 of 2020 and we will share more information once
it's available. 

## Release Notes

In this section, we will cover historical information on
past releases and how you can learn more. 

### 1.6.0 (2020-01-14)

This release adds major new features and bugfixes since the 1.5.1 release.
We deem it moderate priority for upgrading.

The major new feature in this release allows users to keep the aggregated
data in a continuous aggregate while dropping the raw data with drop_chunks.
This allows users to save storage by keeping only the aggregates.

The semantics of the refresh_lag parameter for continuous aggregates has
been changed to be relative to the current timestamp instead of the maximum
value in the table. This change requires that an integer_now func be set on
hypertables with integer-based time columns to use continuous aggregates on
this table.

We added a timescaledb.ignore_invalidation_older_than parameter for continuous
aggregatess. This parameter accept a time-interval (e.g. 1 month). if set,
it limits the amount of time for which to process invalidation. Thus, if
timescaledb.ignore_invalidation_older_than = '1 month', then any modifications
for data older than 1 month from the current timestamp at modification time may
not cause continuous aggregate to be updated. This limits the amount of work
that a backfill can trigger. By default, all invalidations are processed.

**Major Features**
* #1589 Allow drop_chunks while keeping continuous aggregates

**Minor Features**
* #1568 Add ignore_invalidation_older_than option to continuous aggs
* #1575 Reorder group-by clause for continuous aggregates
* #1592 Improve continuous agg user messages

**Bugfixes**
* #1565 Fix partial select query for continuous aggregate
* #1591 Fix locf treat_null_as_missing option
* #1594 Fix error in compression constraint check
* #1603 Add join info to compressed chunk
* #1606 Fix constify params during runtime exclusion
* #1607 Delete compression policy when drop hypertable
* #1608 Add jobs to timescaledb_information.policy_stats
* #1609 Fix bug with parent table in decompression
* #1624 Fix drop_chunks for ApacheOnly
* #1632 Check for NULL before dereferencing variable

**Thanks**
* @optijon for reporting an issue with locf treat_null_as_missing option
* @acarrera42 for reporting an issue with constify params during runtime exclusion
* @ChristopherZellermann for reporting an issue with the compression constraint check
* @SimonDelamare for reporting an issue with joining hypertables with compression

### 1.5.1 (2019-11-12)

This maintenance release contains bugfixes since the 1.5.0 release. We deem it low
priority for upgrading.

In particular the fixes contained in this maintenance release address potential
segfaults and no other security vulnerabilities. The bugfixes are related to bloom
indexes and updates from previous versions.

**Bugfixes**
* #1523 Fix bad SQL updates from previous updates
* #1526 Fix hypertable model
* #1530 Set active snapshots in multi-xact index create

**Thanks**
* @84660320 for reporting an issue with bloom indexes
* @gumshoes @perhamm @jermudgeon @gmisagm for reporting the issue with updates

### 1.5.0 (2019-10-31)

This release adds major new features and bugfixes since the 1.4.2 release.
We deem it moderate priority for upgrading.

This release adds compression as a major new feature.
Multiple type-specific compression options are available in this release
(including DeltaDelta with run-length-encoding for integers and
timestamps; Gorilla compression for floats; dictionary-based compression
for any data type, but specifically for low-cardinality datasets;
and other LZ-based techniques). Individual columns can be compressed with
type-specific compression algorithms as Postgres' native row-based format
are rolled up into columnar-like arrays on a per chunk basis.
The query planner then handles transparent decompression for compressed
chunks at execution time.

This release also adds support for basic data tiering by supporting
the migration of chunks between tablespaces, as well as support for
parallel query coordination to the ChunkAppend node.
Previously ChunkAppend would rely on parallel coordination in the
underlying scans for parallel plans.

More information can be found on [our blog](https://blog.timescale.com/blog/building-columnar-compression-in-a-row-oriented-database)
or in this [tutorial](https://docs.timescale.com/latest/tutorials/compression-tutorial)

**For this release only**, you will need to restart the database before running
`ALTER EXTENSION`

**Major Features**
* #1393 Moving chunks between different tablespaces
* #1433 Make ChunkAppend parallel aware
* #1434 Introducing native compression, multiple compression algorithms, and hybrid row/columnar projections

**Minor Features**
* #1471 Allow setting reloptions on chunks
* #1479 Add next_start option to alter_job_schedule
* #1481 Add last_successful_finish to bgw_job_stats

### 1.4.0 (2019-07-18)

This release contains major new functionality for continuous aggregates
and adds performance improvements for analytical queries.

In version 1.3.0 we added support for continuous aggregates which
was initially limited to one continuous aggregate per hypertable.
With this release, we remove this restriction and allow multiple
continuous aggregates per hypertable.

This release adds a new custom node ChunkAppend that can perform
execution time constraint exclusion and is also used for ordered
append. Ordered append no longer requires a LIMIT clause and now
supports space partitioning and ordering by time_bucket.

### 1.3.0 (2019-05-06)

This release contains major new functionality that we call continuous aggregates.

Aggregate queries which touch large swathes of time-series data can take a long
time to compute because the system needs to scan large amounts of data on every
query execution. Our continuous aggregates continuously calculate the
results of a query in the background and materialize the results. Queries to the
continuous aggregate view are then significantly faster as they do not need to
touch the raw data in the hypertable, instead using the pre-computed aggregates
in the view.

Continuous aggregates are somewhat similar to PostgreSQL materialized
views, but unlike a materialized view, continuous
aggregates do not need to be refreshed manually; the view will be refreshed
automatically in the background as new data is added, or old data is
modified. Additionally, it does not need to re-calculate all of the data on
every refresh. Only new and/or invalidated data will be calculated.  Since this
re-aggregation is automatic, it doesn’t add any maintenance burden to your
database.

Our continuous aggregate approach supports high-ingest rates by avoiding the
high-write amplification associated with trigger-based approaches. Instead,
we use invalidation techniques to track what data has changed, and then correct
the materialized aggregate the next time that the automated process executes.

More information can be found on [our docs overview](http://docs.timescale.com/using-timescaledb/continuous-aggregates)
or in this [tutorial](http://docs.timescale.com/tutorials/continuous-aggs-tutorial).

### 1.2.0 (2019-01-29)

**This is our first release to include Timescale-Licensed features, in addition to new Apache-2 capabilities.**

We are excited to be introducing new time-series analytical functions, advanced data lifecycle management capabilities, and improved performance.
- **Time-series analytical functions**: Users can now use our `time_bucket_gapfill` function, to write complex gapfilling, last object carried forward, and interpolation queries.
- **Advanced data lifecycle management**: We are introducing scheduled policies, which use our background worker framework to manage time-series data. In this release, we support scheduled `drop_chunks` and `reorder`.
- **Improved performance**: We added support for ordered appends, which optimize a large range of queries - particularly those that are ordered by time and contain a LIMIT clause. Please note that ordered appends do not support ordering by `time_bucket` at this time.
- **Postgres 11 Support**: We added beta support for PG11 in 1.1.0. We're happy to announce that our PG11 support is now out of beta, and fully supported.

This release adds code under a new license, LICENSE_TIMESCALE. This code can be found in `tsl`.

**For this release only**, you will need to restart the database before running
`ALTER EXTENSION`

### 1.1.1 (2018-12-20)

This release contains bugfixes.

**High-level changes**
* Fix issue when upgrading with pg_upgrade
* Fix a segfault that sometimes appeared in long COPYs
* Other bug and stability fixes

**Notable commits**

* [f99b540] Avoid loading twice in parallel workers and load only from $libdir

* @damirda for reporting the copy bug

### 1.1.0 (2018-12-13)

Our 1.1 release introduces beta support for PG 11, as well as several performance optimizations aimed at improving chunk exclusion for read queries. We are also packaging our new timescale-tune tool (currently in beta) with our Debian and Linux releases. If you encounter any issues with our beta features, please file a Github issue.

**Potential breaking changes**
- In addition to optimizing first() / last() to utilize indices for non-group-by queries, we adjusted its sorting behavior to match that of PostgreSQL’s max() and min() functions. Previously, if the column being sorted had NULL values, a NULL would be returned. First() and last() now instead ignore NULL values.

**Notable Commits**

* [a534ed4] Fix upsert TLE translation when mapping variable numbers
* [aecd55b] Check extension exists for DROP OWNED and DROP EXTENSION

### 1.0.0 (2018-10-30)

**This is our 1.0 release!**

For notable commits between 0.12.0/0.12.1 and this final 1.0 release, please see previous entries for the release candidates (rc1, rc2, and rc3).

**Thanks**
To all the external contributors who helped us debug the release candidates, as well as anyone who has contributed bug reports, PRs, or feedback on Slack, GitHub, and other channels. All input has been valuable and helped us create the product we have today!

**Potential breaking changes**
* To better align with the ISO standard so that time bucketing starts each week by default on a Monday (rather than Saturday), the `time_bucket` epoch/origin has been changed from January 1, 2000 to January 3, 2000.  The function now includes an `origin` parameter that can be used to adjust this.
* Error codes are now prefixed with `TS` instead of the prior `IO` prefix. If you were checking for these error codes by name, please update your code.


**For releases prior to 1.0, please visit the [changelog](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).**
