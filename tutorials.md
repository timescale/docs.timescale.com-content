# Tutorials

- **[Start Here - Hello NYC][Hello NYC]**: If you are new to TimescaleDB
or even SQL, check
out our tutorial with NYC taxicab data to get an idea of the capabilities our
database has to offer.
- **[Geospatial data][postGIS]**: If you want to delve into the further potential of
TimescaleDB, we have guidance for more advanced topics
like PostGIS integration.
- **[Time-series Forecasting][Forecasting]**: Use R, Apache MADlib and Python to perform
data analysis and make forecasts on your data.
- **[Replication][]**: TimescaleDB takes advantage of well established PostgreSQL methods for replication.  Here we provide a detailed guide along with additional resources for setting up streaming replicas.
- **[Continuous Aggregates][]**: Getting started with continuous aggregates. 
- **[Migrate from InfluxDB with Outflux][Outflux]**: Use our open-source migration tool to transfer your data from InfluxDB to TimescaleDB.
- **[Prometheus adapter][]**: Integrate TimescaleDB with Prometheus monitoring for scalability and SQL powers
- **[Sample data sets][Data Sets]**: And if you want to explore on your own
with some sample data, we have some ready-made data sets for you to explore.
