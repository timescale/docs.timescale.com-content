# Getting Started with Grafana and TimescaleDB

[Grafana][grafana-website] is an open source analytics and monitoring solution
often used to visualize time-series data. In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to:

- Setup Grafana and [Timescale Cloud][timescale-cloud]
- Use Grafana to visualize metrics stored in TimescaleDB
- Visualize geospatial data using Grafana

### Setup Grafana and Timescale Cloud
First, you’ll want to [setup Timescale Cloud][timescale-cloud-install]. If you’d
prefer to run your own instance of TimescaleDB, follow [the installation instructions][timescaledb-install]
and the remainder of the tutorial should be fairly straightforward to follow.

If you’ve followed the setup instructions, you should have a working version
of TimescaleDB with data preloaded. In our case,
we will use the New York City taxicab data found in the
[Hello, Timescale!][hello-timescale] tutorial. Be sure to follow the full
tutorial if you’re interested in background on how to use TimescaleDB.

If you’re using Timescale Cloud, you can setup a Grafana Metrics Dashboard
from the **Create Service** flow.

>:TIP: Alternatively, you can setup [Grafana Cloud][grafana-cloud] and follow the rest of the instructions below. Note that Grafana Cloud is more feature-rich than the open source version of Grafana included with Timescale Cloud, but does require a paid subscription from Grafana.

Finally, you need to configure Grafana to connect to your Timescale Cloud
instance (or your own installation of TimescaleDB).

Start by selecting 'Add Data Source' and choosing the 'PostgreSQL' option
in the SQL group:

<img class="main-content__illustration" src="https://assets.iobeam.com/images/docs/screenshots-for-grafana-tutorial/add_data_source.png" alt="Adding Postgres to Grafana"/>

In the configuration screen, supply the `Host`, `Database`, `User`, and `Password` for
your Timescale Cloud instance (or TimescaleDB server).

If you’re a Timescale Cloud user, you can see this in the Service Dashboard for your
Timescale Cloud instance.

>:TIP: Don’t forget to add the port number after your host URI. For example, `hostname.timescaledb.io:19660`. And don’t forget to change the database name, if necessary.

Since we will be connecting to a TimescaleDB instance (in Timescale Cloud) for this
tutorial, we will also want to check the option for 'TimescaleDB' in the
'PostgreSQL details' section of the PostgreSQL configuration screen.

We will also change the 'Name' of the database to `NYC Taxi Cab Data`. This is
optional, but will inform others who use our Grafana dashboard what this data source
contains.

Once done, click 'Save & Test'. You should receive confirmation that your database
connection is working.

### Creating a Grafana Dashboard and Panel

Grafana is organized into ‘Dashboards’ and ‘Panels’. A dashboard represents a view
onto the performance of a system, and each dashboard consists of one or more panels,
which represents information about a specific metric related to that system.

We will start by creating a new dashboard. In the far left of the Grafana user
interface, you’ll see a '+' icon. If you hover over it, you’ll see a 'Create' menu,
within which is a 'Dashboard' option. Select that 'Dashboard' option.

After creating a new dashboard, you’ll see a 'New Panel' screen, with options
for 'Add Query' and 'Choose Visualization'. In the future, if you already have a
dashboard with panels, you can click on the '+' icon at the **top** of the Grafana user
interface, which will enable you to add a panel to an existing dashboard.

To proceed with our tutorial, let’s add a new visualization by clicking on the 'Choose
Visualization' option.

At this point, you’ll have several options for different Grafana visualizations. We will
choose the first option, the 'Graph' visualization.

<img class="main-content__illustration" src="https://assets.iobeam.com/images/docs/screenshots-for-grafana-tutorial/grafana_visualizations.png" alt="Grafana visualizations to choose from"/>

There are multiple ways to configure our panel, but we will accept all the defaults
and create a simple 'Lines' graph.

In the far left section of the Grafana user interface, select the 'Queries' tab.

<img class="main-content__illustration" src="https://assets.iobeam.com/images/docs/screenshots-for-grafana-tutorial/create_grafana_query.png" alt="How to create a new Grafana query"/>

Instead of using the Grafana query builder, we will edit our query directly. In the
view, click on the 'Edit SQL' button at the bottom.

<img class="main-content__illustration" src="https://assets.iobeam.com/images/docs/screenshots-for-grafana-tutorial/edit_sql_in_grafana.png" alt="Edit custom SQL queries in Grafana"/>

Before we can begin authoring our query, we also want to set the Query database to the New
York City taxi cab datasource we connected to earlier:

### Visualize metrics stored in TimescaleDB

Let’s start by creating a visualization that answers the question **How many rides took place on each day?**
from the [Hello, Timescale!][hello-timescale] tutorial.

From the tutorial, you can see the standard SQL syntax for our query:

```sql
SELECT date_trunc('day', pickup_datetime) AS day,
  COUNT(*)
FROM rides
GROUP BY day
ORDER BY day;
```

We will need to alter this query to support Grafana’s unique query syntax.

#### Modifying the SELECT statement

First, we will modify the `date_trunc` function to use the TimescaleDB `time_bucket`
function. You can consult the TimescaleDB [API Reference on time_bucket][time-bucket-reference]
for more information on how to use it properly.

Let’s examine the `SELECT` portion of this query. First, we will bucket our results into
one day groupings using the `time_bucket` function. If you set the 'Format' of a Grafana
panel to be 'Time series', for use in Graph panel for example, then the query must return
a column named `time` that returns either a SQL `datetime` or any numeric datatype
representing a Unix epoch.

So, part 1 of this new query is modified so that the output of the `time_bucket` grouping
is labeled `time` as Grafana requires, while part 2 is unchanged:

```sql
SELECT
  --1--
  time_bucket('1 day', pickup_datetime) AS "time",
  --2--
  COUNT(*)
FROM rides
```

#### The Grafana \_\_timeFilter function

Grafana time-series panels include a tool that enables the end-user to filter on a given
time range. A “time filter,” if you will. Not surprisingly, Grafana has a way to link the
user interface construct in a Grafana panel with the query itself. In this case,
the `$__timefilter()` function.

In the modified query below, we will use the `$__timefilter()` function
to set the `pickup_datetime` column as the filtering range for our visualizations.

```sql
SELECT
  --1--
  time_bucket('1 day', pickup_datetime) AS "time",
  --2--
  COUNT(*)
FROM rides
WHERE $__timeFilter(pickup_datetime)
```

#### Referencing elements in our query

Finally, we want to group our visualization by the time buckets we’ve selected,
and we want to order the results by the time buckets as well. So, our `GROUP BY`
and `ORDER BY` statements will reference `time`.

With these changes, this is our final Grafana query:

```sql
SELECT
  --1--
  time_bucket('1 day', pickup_datetime) AS time,
  --2--
  COUNT(*)
FROM rides
WHERE $__timeFilter(pickup_datetime)
GROUP BY time
ORDER BY time
```

When we visualize this query in Grafana, we see the following:

<img class="main-content__illustration" src="https://assets.iobeam.com/images/docs/screenshots-for-grafana-tutorial/grafana_query_results.png" alt="Visualizing time-series data in Grafana"/>

>:TIP: Remember to set the time filter in the upper right corner of your Grafana dashboard. If you're using the pre-built sample dataset for this example, you will want to set your time filter around January 1st, 2016.

Currently, the data is bucketed into 1 day groupings. Adjust the `time_bucket`
function to be bucketed into 5 minute groupings instead and compare the graphs:

```sql
SELECT
  --1--
  time_bucket('5m', pickup_datetime) AS time,
  --2--
  COUNT(*)
FROM rides
WHERE $__timeFilter(pickup_datetime)
GROUP BY time
ORDER BY time
```

When we visualize this query, it will look like this:

<img class="main-content__illustration" src="https://assets.iobeam.com/images/docs/screenshots-for-grafana-tutorial/grafana_query_results_5m.png" alt="Visualizing time-series data in Grafana"/>


### Visualize geospatial data stored in TimescaleDB

The NYC Taxi Cab data also contains the location of each ride pickup. In the
[Hello, Timescale! Tutorial][hello-timescale], we examined rides that originated
near Times Square. Let’s build on that query and
**visualize rides whose distance traveled was greater than five miles in Manhattan**.

We can do this in Grafana using the 'Worldmap Panel'. We will start by creating a
new panel, selecting 'New Visualization', and selecting the 'Worldmap Panel'.

Once again, we will edit our query directly. In the Query screen, be sure
to select your NYC Taxicab Data as the data source. In the 'Format as' dropdown,
select 'Table'. Click on 'Edit SQL' and enter the following query in the text window:

```sql
SELECT time_bucket('5m', rides.pickup_datetime) AS time,
       rides.trip_distance AS value,
       rides.pickup_latitude AS latitude,
       rides.pickup_longitude AS longitude
FROM rides
WHERE $__timeFilter(rides.pickup_datetime) AND
  ST_Distance(pickup_geom,
              ST_Transform(ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(-73.9851,40.7589),4326),2163)
  ) < 2000
GROUP BY time,
         rides.trip_distance,
         rides.pickup_latitude,
         rides.pickup_longitude
ORDER BY time
LIMIT 500;
```

Let’s dissect this query. First, we’re looking to plot rides with visual markers that
denote the trip distance. Trips with longer distances will get different visual treatments
on our map. We will use the `trip_distance` as the value for our plot. We will store
this result in the `value` field.

In the second and third lines of the `SELECT` statement, we are using the `pickup_longitude`
and `pickup_latitude` fields in the database and mapping them to variables `longitude`
and `latitude`, respectively.

In the `WHERE` clause, we are applying a geospatial boundary to look for trips within
2000m of Times Square.

Finally, in the `GROUP BY` clause, we supply the `trip_distance` and location variables
so that Grafana can plot data properly.

>:WARNING: This query may take a while, depending on the speed of your Internet connection. This is why we’re using the `LIMIT` statement for demonstration purposes.

Now let’s configure our Worldmap visualization. Select the 'Visualization' tab in the far
left of the Grafana user interface. You’ll see options for 'Map Visual Options', 'Map Data Options',
and more.

First, make sure the 'Map Data Options' are set to 'table' and 'current'.  Then in
the 'Field Mappings' section. We will set the 'Table Query Format' to be ‘Table’.
We can map the 'Latitude Field' to our `latitude` variable, the 'Longitude Field' to
our `longitude` variable, and the 'Metric' field to our `value` variable.

In the 'Map Visual Options', set the 'Min Circle Size' to 1 and the 'Max Circle Size' to 5.

In the 'Threshold Options' set the 'Thresholds' to '2,5,10'. This will auto configure a set
of colors. Any plot whose `value` is below 2 will be a color, any `value` between 2 and 5 will
be another color, any `value` between 5 and 10 will be a third color, and any `value` over 10
will be a fourth color.

Your configuration should look like this:

<img class="main-content__illustration" src="https://assets.iobeam.com/images/docs/screenshots-for-grafana-tutorial/grafana-fieldmapping.png" alt="Mapping Worldmap fields to query results in Grafana"/>

At this point, data should be flowing into our Worldmap visualization, like so:

<img class="main-content__illustration" src="https://assets.iobeam.com/images/docs/screenshots-for-grafana-tutorial/grafana_worldmap_query_results.png" alt="Visualizing time series data in PostgreSQL using the Grafana Worldmap"/>

You should be able to edit the time filter at the top of your visualization to see trip pickup data
for different timeframes.

### Using Grafana variables

Our goal here will be to create a variable which controls the type of ride displayed in the
visual, based on the payment type used for the ride.

There are several types of payments, which we can see in the `payment_types` table:

```text
 payment_type | description
--------------+-------------
            1 | credit card
            2 | cash
            3 | no charge
            4 | dispute
            5 | unknown
            6 | voided trip
(6 rows)
```

Grafana includes many types of variables, and variables in Grafana function just like
variables in programming languages. We define a variable, and then we can reference it
in our queries.

#### Define a new Grafana variable
To create a new variable, go to your Grafana dashboard settings, navigate to the 'Variable'
option in the side-menu, and then click the 'Add variable' button.

In this case, we use the 'Query' type, where our variable will be defined as the results
of SQL query.

Under the 'General' section, we’ll name our variable `payment_type` and give it a type of `Query`.
Then, we’ll assign it the label of “Payment Type", which is how it will appear in a drop-down menu.

We will select our data source and supply the query:

```sql
SELECT payment_type FROM payment_types;
```

Turn on 'Multi-value' and 'Include All option'. This will enable users of your dashboard to
select more than one payment type. Our configuration should look like this:

<img class="main-content__illustration" src="https://assets.iobeam.com/images/docs/screenshots-for-grafana-tutorial/grafana_define_variable.png" alt="Using a variable to filter the results in a Grafana visualization"/>

Click 'Add' to save your variable.

#### Use the variable in a Grafana panel

Let's edit the WorldMap panel we created in the previous section. The first thing you'll
notice is that now that we've defined a variable for this dashboard, there's now a drop-down
for that variable in the upper left hand corner of the panel.

We can use this variable to filter the results of our query using the `WHERE` clause in SQL.
We will check and see if `rides.payment_type` is in the array of the variable, which we've
named `$payment_type`.

Let's modify our earlier query like so:

```sql
SELECT time_bucket('5m', rides.pickup_datetime) AS time,
       rides.trip_distance AS value,
       rides.pickup_latitude AS latitude,
       rides.pickup_longitude AS longitude
FROM rides
WHERE $__timeFilter(rides.pickup_datetime) AND
  ST_Distance(pickup_geom,
              ST_Transform(ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(-73.9851,40.7589),4326),2163)
  ) < 2000 AND
  rides.payment_type IN ($payment_type)
GROUP BY time,
         rides.trip_distance,
         rides.pickup_latitude,
         rides.pickup_longitude
ORDER BY time
LIMIT 500;
```

Now we can use the drop-down to filter our rides based on the type of payment used:

<img class="main-content__illustration" src="https://assets.iobeam.com/images/docs/screenshots-for-grafana-tutorial/grafana_worldmap_query_with_variable.png" alt="Visualizing time series data in PostgreSQL using the Grafana Worldmap and filtering using a variable"/>

#### Improving the Grafana filter to be human readable

But this filter isn't very attractive. We can't tell what '1' means. Fortunately,
when we set up our NYC Taxi Cab dataset, we created a `payment_types` table (which
we queried earlier). The `payment_types.description` field has a more readable
explanation of what each payment code means, for example, 'credit card', 'cash',
and so on. Those readable descriptions are what we want in our drop-down.

Click 'Dashboard settings' (the "gear" icon in the upper-right of your Grafana
visualizations). Select the 'Variables' tab on the left, and click the `$payment_types`
variable. Modify your query to retrieve the `description` and store it in the `__text`
field and retrieve the `payment_type` and store it in the `__value` field, like so:

```sql
SELECT description AS "__text", payment_type AS "__value" FROM payment_types
```

Your configuration should look like this now:

<img class="main-content__illustration" src="https://assets.iobeam.com/images/docs/screenshots-for-grafana-tutorial/grafana_modify_variable.png" alt="Modify our grafana variable to be more human readable"/>

There's no need to alter the query for the WorldMap visualization itself.
Whatever database column is assigned as `__text` is used whenever the variable
is displayed and whatever is assigned to `__value` is used as the actual value
when Grafana makes a query.

As you can see, a variable can be used in a query in much the same way you'd
use a variable in any programming language.

### Graphing nirvana with Grafana

Grafana is a fantastic way to visualize your time-series data. It’s powerful and
flexible and makes it possible for you to get better insight into the information
you’re storing in TimescaleDB.
