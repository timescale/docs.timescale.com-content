# Updating TimescaleDB versions [](update)

This section describes how to upgrade between different versions of
TimescaleDB. TimescaleDB supports **in-place updates only**:
you don't need to dump and restore your data, and versions are published with
automated migration scripts that convert any internal state if necessary.

>:WARNING: There is currently no automated way to downgrade to an earlier release of TimescaleDB without setting up 
>a new instance of PostgreSQL with a previous release of TimescaleDB and then using `pg_restore`
>from a backup.

### TimescaleDB Release Compatibility [](compatibility)

TimescaleDB currently has two major release versions listed below. Please ensure that your version of
PostgreSQL is supported with the extension version you want to install or update.
